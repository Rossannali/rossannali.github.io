								<h2><strong>Data Analyst  |  CUBE Global | April 2023- Current </strong> </h2>
								<p>A RegTech/ FinTech company that provides a software service to Financial sectors. </p>
								
								<p><strong>PROJECT: Build A Data Source- </strong> </p>

								<p>I got brought onto a small team to lead and enhance data collection and present historical RegTech data to the wider organisation.
									I created a Microsoft Access Database that captured data 4 times a day, which was used by all team members to create their personal reports.   </p>
								
								<p>I used Power Platform tools to create an automated workflow in Power BI that sent out alerts to Team channels. This allowed teams to further
									 investigate the high volumes from Financial Issuing bodies and work on any issues throughout the day and improve productivity. </p>


								<h2><strong>Data Analyst  |  Feedr by EatFirst | May 2022- March 2023 </strong> </h2>
								<p>A catering company – supplying food and drinks to bespoke events and work offices. </p>

								<p><strong>PROJECT: Vendor Mapping and Automation - </strong> </p>
								<p>A dashboard in Power BI reporting all the important data acquired through Sales' prefered CRM platforms- forecasting the MRR and ARR on recurring deals. 
									With the collaboration of engineering team, I mapped out geographical data in Power BI that presented the Sales and Ops team with the potential distance in minutes between a food vendor and customer. </p>
									<p>This strategic initiative yielded a report that shows the best matched vendors based on the customers criteria. The automation of matches based on the criteria and distance, provided more food variety 
									than before. Aswell, been able to reduce several complications around the quality of food on arrival and boosted customer satisfaction by 37%. </p>
							

									<p><strong>PROJECT: Sales and Forecasting - </strong></p>
										<p>In this project, I wrote an adhoc query from an array of extracted raw data of undesired formats. I worked with sale CRM tools to gather information of ARR and MRR to calculate and forecast accurate contract deals. 
											With the insights provided, I was able to help set out key market insights and performance indicators
											 on how clients were performing against their ARR and MRR. Further, providing ammunition for Sales to increase deals, and take on leads that were highly profitable. </p>
									
											 <p>The sales team revised and increase deals by an average 23% across 70 companies. These companies were visabily highlighted in the report when clients spent more than 100% of their forecasted MRR every month.
											 In addition, the report also drew attention to companies that needed to spend more, which lead the marketings team to direct promotions and other advertisements to those clients that were under performaing.
											 ]Through out the project, I worked close with my manager and gave guidance to improve data visibility and quality</p>
										
								 <p><strong>PROJECT: Issue Tracking  - </strong></p>
								 <p>In this report, the Ops lead requested a visual and statistical report of internal systems to facilitate data-driven decisions in weekly meetings. 	
								The data collected included reported customer feedback and vendor and courier issues. The data was explored in-depth through historical trends and hierarchical date structures. </p>
								
									<p>The report was widely used across the organisation, the report is aimed to outline and tracks Vendor’s performance and measure satisfactory ratings of the consumer against company standards.
										The report regularly updates and tracks the company’s activities to improve customer experiences– between the vendor and courier and courier to customer.</p>
										<p>I focused the report on a more granular view of issues allowing the end user to report back on historical and daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually basis. 
										The data was captured through consumers written feedback, average rating scores, counts of orders and spend on goods. 
											Additionally, I worked with the developers to apply row-level security (RLS) filters to the Power BI report to safely share information through a portal, for which Vendors were able to access  track their personal performance against company standards.</p>

								<p>Whilst studying my Microsoft Certificate, I Improved the data modelling to be more efficient, cleaner and simpler to use. I used data modelling best practices – the star schema approach (waterfall),  organised and edited relationships,
